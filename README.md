# House-price-prediction---ML

## Overview
In this project, the objective is to predict house prices in India based on various features like BHK number, resale, rera, posted by, under construction, bhk or rk, longitude and latitude.The data set that has used in this project has taken from the kaggle [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anmolkumar/house-price-prediction-challenge/data). I carefully worked on feature engineering, data cleaning, and creating visualizations to make the house price prediction models more accurate and robust. I used advanced techniques like fine-tuning the model parameters with GridSearchCV and combining different models together (Bagging, Boosting, Stacking) to make the predictions better.
